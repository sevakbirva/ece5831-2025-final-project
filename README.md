## Dataset Availability (Raw vs. Processed)

The raw trip data used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miaadnabizadeh/20242025-divvy-bike-sharing-data-cyclistic :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Because the full dataset is large, it is not included in this GitHub repository. Please download the raw files directly from the Kaggle source and place them in the appropriate local `data/` directory before running the pipeline.

After running **Phase 1 through Phase 3** of this project, the pipeline will generate:
- **processed data** in the `data/processed` folder, and
- **model-ready datasets and artifacts** saved into the designated `data/model_ready` folder.
